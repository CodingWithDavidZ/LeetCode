## **Understanding the Problem:**
1. - [x] **Can I restate the problem in my own words:**
    > Take two stings and enter each letter of the stings starting from the first letter of word1 and alternate between the two words with their corresponding letters
2. - [x] **What inputs go into the problem:**
    > Word1
    > Word2
3. - [x] **What is the expected output:**
      + - [x] *Data type:*
            > One String with a combination of letters from each word
      + - [x] *Example:*  
            > (hello) (world) hweolrllod
4. - [x] **Can the output be determined from the input:**
            > Yes
5. - [ ] **How should I label the data:**
      + - [x] *Function Names:*
            > mergeAlternately
      + - [x] *Inputs:*
            > word1
            > word2
      + - [x] *Variables:*
            > result
            > i
            > j
      + - [x] *Outputs:*
            > returned string
6. - [ ] **Concrete Examples:**
      	- [x] **Simple Examples:**
        + - [x] *Input 1:*
            > bottle

7. - [x] **Edge Cases: (NaN, Null, Error, Not Found, etcâ€¦)**
    > hyphenated words
      - Could sanitize the inputs
    > more than one word per input
      - Either add the whitespace or sanitize the inputs
8. - [x] **Break It Down Step-by-step:**
    - create a while loop that will run until both words are empty by incrementing the word.length until it is equal to the length of the word.
9.  - [x] **Can You Solve This Problem:**
      - [x] *Yes, Do it*
      - [ ] *No, What simpler problems can you solve?*
        >
10. - [ ] **REFACTOR AND CLEAN UP!!!**
